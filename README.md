# ML-MODEL-COMPARISON-MODEL
The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning classification models on a given dataset.
The process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, training at least five distinct models, optimizing their hyperparameters, evaluating their performance using key metrics, and visualizing the results in an interactive dashboard.
Problem Statement:
In many real-world classification tasks, selecting the best-performing model requires rigorous comparison across multiple candidate models. This project aims to:
Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Train at least five different classification models.
Record and compare their performances based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and optionally R¬≤ score (where applicable).
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model‚Äôs performance.
Build a dashboard to visualize and compare model performances.
3. Methodology
3.1 Data Preparation
Splitting:
Split the dataset into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (e.g., 20%) subsets using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.
Optionally, include a validation set or use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation with mean/median or removal).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Scale numerical features (e.g., Standard Scaler or Min Max Scaler).
Address class imbalance if applicable (e.g., oversampling with SMOTE, under sampling).
3.2 Model Selection
Train and evaluate at least five classification models, such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost)
2.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
For each model, optimize hyperparameters using techniques like:
Grid Search
Random Search
Bayesian Optimization (optional for efficiency)
Example hyperparameters:
Logistic Regression: C (regularization strength), solver
Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split
SVM: C, kernel type, gamma
Gradient Boosting: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth
Use cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) to evaluate hyperparameter combinations.
2.4 Evaluation Metrics
Compute the following metrics for each model on the test set:
Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: True positives divided by predicted positives.
Recall: True positives divided by actual positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
R¬≤ Score: (Optional, if applicable for specific classification contexts, e.g., ordinal classification).
2.5 Visualization Dashboard
a. Visualizing Model Performance (Baseline vs Tuned)
We created a multi-faceted bar chart to compare the performance of each model across four key metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Each metric displays both the baseline and tuned version of the models side-by-side using color-coded bars (blue for baseline, red for tuned).
This visualization helps identify how much performance improved after hyperparameter tuning.
üîç Note: We ensured consistent model names across all metrics to avoid misalignment, especially for SVM (Support Vector Machine).
b. Key Insights Summary
 Best Overall Performer:
XGBoost (Tuned) consistently achieved the highest scores across most metrics, especially in Precision and Accuracy, making it the s‚Ä¶
